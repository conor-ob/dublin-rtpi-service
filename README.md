Dropwizard service written in Kotlin to provide a unified API to aggregate data from Dublin public transport APIs into a common canonical data model.

Swagger docs and REST playground [here](https://dublin-rtpi.herokuapp.com/swagger.html). The Heroku container sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity so it may need a few seconds to start up.
